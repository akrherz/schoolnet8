What could be improved?
 I find the map to locate my site very awkward to use.  I am looking
for Jordan Creek and it usually takes 2-3 tries before I am able to
hit the right spot.  Could you provide a list of the sites to choose
from as well as the map?

Thanks Daryl
Yep it did as you suggested, before now it went KCCI's Home site. In Plot
time series, could you give precipitation as either percent of total or as
something variable, rather than 4" as full scale. Also instead of wind
direction in degrees may be substituting compass points instead,  i.e. 90=
E, 180=S etc.
Thanks for the shockingly quick response!

Hello Daryl

When I look at the schoolnet computer under the SchoolNet8 Viewer 1.1.0.
The Super Doppler State Radar view doesn't show an updated radar screen.
The other radar screens are up to date.

Thanks

SW Iowa Rural Electric Cooperative is too long of a name!
