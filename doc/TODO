<<< Must switch bar.phtml back before changing the site! >>>

Other Changes:
 [ ] Redo the current ob page with something more interesting.  We just
     borrowed the IBS interface. Maybe segregate the temperatures together
     and make more colors.  Less vertical space would be nice too.
 [ ] Somehow incorperate the site photos and ortho photos in some fashion.
     I really need to figure out why the ortho photos are so large after 
     they come out of the Mapserver scripts.
