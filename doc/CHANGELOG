Changes already sent to live server:
 [x] Wind direction does not appear on the current ob printout.

Other Changes:
 [Mar] Redo the current ob page with something more interesting.  We just
     borrowed the IBS interface. Maybe segregate the temperatures together
     and make more colors.  Less vertical space would be nice too.
 [x] Make all of the URL links relative, so that the _dev site actually
     works.  I will work on this.
 [x] Build up the WAP interface.  I have created a wap directory and will
     be working on the current ob page.  Also generating the select box,
     so that users need not know the site ID.
 [x] Create a footer.php include just like the header and put it in on all
     the pages.  The footer should have some more info, link to a
     disclaimer, and link to the IEM.
 [x] Make download worker.php more robust with error checking...
 [x] Switch the use of "KCCI" and "CIPCO".  It will make life easier.
