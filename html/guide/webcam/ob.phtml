<p>The SchoolNet8 project includes a network of Internet accessible web 
cameras.  These cameras provide live looks at over a dozen 
locations throughout Central Iowa.  These images are also archived on the 
website, so you can see what is happening right now and 
what happened yesterday or even last year!</p>
